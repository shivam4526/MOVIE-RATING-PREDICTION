# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction

Welcome to the **Movie Rating Prediction** project! This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, cast, and other metadata. The goal is to help estimate the likely rating of a new or existing movie.

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning
✅ Feature engineering (e.g., genre encoding, text vectorization)
✅ Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✅ Model building using regression/classification algorithms
✅ Hyperparameter tuning
✅ Model evaluation and visualization
✅ Deployment-ready prediction script

## 🧩 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas, NumPy
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
* (Optional) Flask / Streamlit for deployment

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running:

1️⃣ Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-rating-prediction.git
cd movie-rating-prediction
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ Explore the data:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb
```

4️⃣ Train the model:

```bash
python src/model.py
```

5️⃣ Predict:

```bash
python app/predict.py
```

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

* **Input**: Movie metadata (title, genre, director, cast, release year, etc.)
* **Output**: Predicted rating (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 10)
* **Approach**: Regression / Classification models trained on IMDb-like datasets
* **Evaluation**: Metrics such as RMSE, accuracy, and confusion matrix

## 🌟 Future Improvements

✅ Use deep learning models for improved performance
✅ Integrate more features (social media buzz, reviews, etc.)
✅ Build a web interface for easy user interaction
✅ Deploy as a REST API on cloud platforms
